PPT Generalizability, Reliability and Validity PowerPoint From slideserve.com
Reliability is about the consistency of a measure, and validity is about the accuracy of a measure. Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure (whether the results really do represent what they are supposed to measure). A validity definition is a bit more complex because it’s more difficult to assess than reliability. If a man is 1.81m tall, a measurement of 1.743 is precise but not accurate.
