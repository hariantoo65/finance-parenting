The right of your mother on you is that you should know that nobody could endure the trouble and the conditions under which she protected you and nourished you with the juice of her life, and tried with her heart and soul to satisfy all your needs in relation to hunger, thirst, dress, etc. God used that parent, flaws and all, to accomplish his good plan. Allah says in the holy qur’an: Respect for parents is a key to the gates of paradise.
