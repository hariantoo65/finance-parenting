This can be split into internal and external reliability.validity refers to whether the study or measuring test is measuring what is claims to measure. • reliability is related with the consistency of the measurements whereas validity is focused more on how accurate the measurements are. Reliability can be estimated by comparing different versions of the same measurement. The validity focuses on reliability whereas the reliability focuses on consistency.
