Reliability is simple to measure, as it only depends on a consistent set. There are several key differences between validity and reliability to be aware of: From a journal article, the researchers used a national database called nsduh to measure the amount of prescription drug. A validity definition is a bit more complex because it’s more difficult to assess than reliability.
