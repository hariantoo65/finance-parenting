<meta name="description" content="Single Parent Rate By State, A record 8% of households with minor children in the united states are headed by a single father, up from just over 1% in 1960, according to a pew research center analysis of decennial census and american community survey data. Children under the age of 18 live with one parent and no other adults (23%), more than three times the share of children around the world who do so (7%).
U.s. Has World�s Highest Rate Of Children Living In Single-Parent Households | Pew Research Center From pewresearch.org
Single parents in the united states have become more common since the second half of the 20th century. Despite negative assumptions that most single moms selfishly chose to raise their kids solo, the majority of individuals raising children alone started out in committed relationships and never expected to be single parents. In neighboring canada, the share is 15%. Moreover, the degree of fluctuation was much lower for single female household.
