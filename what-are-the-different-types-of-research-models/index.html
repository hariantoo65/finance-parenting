Quantitative research is a very close research model in various fields of science. Researchers collect data of the targeted population, place, or event by using different types of qualitative research analysis. Observational research often has no clearly defined research problem, and questions may arise during the course of the study. The six types of qualitative research are the phenomenological model, the ethnographic model, grounded theory, case study, historical model and the narrative model.
