One day you will remember me, one day you will laugh at the memories, one day you will try to find me. Everyone is always caught off guard. Begin with a sincere apology, like, i�m incredibly sorry for what i did and how it hurt you. you should also express regret, so your mom knows you�re taking responsibility for your actions. Instead of putting yourself up a notch higher than her, look gently into her eyes and tell her what a good mother she is!
