Validity is defined as the extent to which a concept is accurately measured in a quantitative study. The concept of “individual” is seen differently between humanistic and positive psychologists due to differing philosophical perspectives: How do you ensure validity and reliability in qualitative research? Robson (2002) suggested a number of strategies aimed at addressing these threats to validity, namely prolonged involvement , triangulation , peer debriefing , member checking , negative case.
