Honoring our parents is so important in islam that it has been mentioned alongside the worship of allah, among the greatest of commandments. Being humble and kind towards parents is an essential part of islam. You shall regard the parents, the relatives, the orphans, the poor, the related neighbour, the unrelated neighbour, the close associate, the travelling alien, and your servants. وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلَا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئًا ۖ.
