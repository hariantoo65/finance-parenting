Rosalie Chiang Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Parents, Ethnicity StarSecrets.</h3><p>Only 10% found tweens to be the hardest age. What is the hardest age? My son had challenging times on and off during ages 2 and 3, in some ways due to his being on the autism spectrum (though very mildly). While divorce can have devastating effects on a child at any age, perhaps the most difficult time in a child�s life for him to experience such a separation is between the ages of 2 and 4 when his parents are the center of his world. There is no doubt about it. The most dangerous age is 14.</p>
<p>Eight being the troublesome year likely comes as a surprise to many parents especially since parents polled found age six to be easier than they expected. Twenty one percent of our respondents thought that infants were the most difficult and 24% found teens the most challenging. Mothers of children who ranged between ages 12 and 14 reported feeling worse than parents of infants, toddlers, elementary school children, and adult children. <em>Rosalie Chiang Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Parents, Ethnicity StarSecrets</em>, There is no doubt about it.</p>
