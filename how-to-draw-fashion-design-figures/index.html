Sketch of fashion design step by step by VegakaVGK on From pinterest.com
Line quality keeps your sketch from looking “flat”, and it much more like the way we see…so it looks more natural, dynamic, realistic. To draw like a fashion designer, sketch really tall and thin models for all of your designs. There’s an excellent book called figure drawing for fashion design that i think you’ll be very interested in, definitely check that out. Don�t worry about making them look realistic since the focus will be on the fashion designs themselves.
