Parents that have adopted this style of parenting rarely set or enforce rules and rarely discipline their children, sometimes acting like a friend rather than an authority figure. Parents adopt a very friendly parenting approach in this kind of parenting style, and they often do not expect their children to act or behave in a mature manner.
