How to Start a Clothing Line Business or Apparel From powerhomebiz.com
My initial estimates we’re somewhere around $5,000 to truly get everything up and running, but as it stands, i have put around $12,000 into one hundred since last july. This is where you will place a bulk order for your designs. You need to build a website that�s appealing and that can be done for $50 usually, for a really good website that has everything you want and need. The bottom line is that any sales efforts are going to cost some money.
