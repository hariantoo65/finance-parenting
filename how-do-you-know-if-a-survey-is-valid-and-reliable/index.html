<meta name="description" content="How Do You Know If A Survey Is Valid And Reliable, Validity is the extent to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure and performs as it is designed to perform. For example, if you weigh yourself four times on a scale and get the values 165, 164, 165, and 166, then you can say that the scale is reasonably reliable since the weights are consistent.

A common measurement of this type of validity is the correlation coefficient between two measures. A valid one is accurate. The reliability and validity of a measure is not established by any single study but by the pattern of results across multiple studies. How good are these measurements?

<p>Define Content Validity Of A Test David SimchiLevi If a questionnaire used to conduct a study lacks these two very important characteristics, then the conclusion drawn from that particular study can be referred to as invalid. Validity of a test is sometimes also mentioned. For example, an instrument is reliable if each time you use it (and assuming no intervention), you get the same information. Internal validity dictates.</p>
