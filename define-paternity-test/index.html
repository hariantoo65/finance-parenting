If the tested man cannot be excluded, a probability of paternity is issued. An analysis, usually of the dna or blood type of a mother, child, and putative father, to estimate the probability that the man is the biological father of the child. Negative results prove he was not the father but positive results show only that he could be. A legal paternity test is a genetic test to determine whether a man is the biological father of a child.
