Difference Between Validity and Reliability in 2020 (With images From pinterest.com
Validity refers to a situation when a test or instrument is accurately measuring what it’s supposed to. There are two main types of validity in research: Reliability refers to the degree of reproducibility of the results if the measurement is repeated. If the collected data shows the same results after being tested using various methods and sample groups, the information is reliable.

Initial Validity and Reliability of the Trent Attribution Profile.</h3><p>Validity refers to a situation when a test or instrument is accurately measuring what it’s supposed to. To determine stability, a measure or test is repeated on the same subjects at a future date. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure (whether the results can be reproduced under the same conditions). “if a test is so unreliable that it produces two different estimates of a person’s present behaviour, how can we believe that it gives a good estimate of future behaviour” [6] ? The points presented below, explains the fundamental differences between validity and reliability: On the other hand, reliability refers to the degree of reproducibility of the results, if repeated measurements are done.</p>
