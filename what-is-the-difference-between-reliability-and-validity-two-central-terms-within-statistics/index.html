The reliability refers to the extent to which a measurement instrument provides consistent results. There are four main types of validity: In other words, it ascertains the correlation between each question of the entire test. There are two distinct criteria by which researchers evaluate their measures:

This is a commonly but inappropriately used term that is not a formal validity concept. However, the things required to achieve a very high degree of reliability can impact negatively on validity.

<p>It’s important to consider reliability and validity when you are creating your research. Reliability refers to the consistency of the measurement.

Validity is harder to assess, but it can be estimated by comparing the results to other relevant data or theory. If an experiment is invalid because of an inappropriate method being used, the result may still be reliable, it just won’t address the aim of the experiment. 蠟 reliability refers to how consistent the results of a study are or the consistent results of a measuring test. It splits the questions that probe the same construct into two sets of equal proportions, and the data obtained from both sets is compared and matched in order to determine the correlation, if any, between these two sets of data. There are two distinct criteria by which researchers evaluate their measures:</p>
