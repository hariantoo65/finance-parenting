<p>Islamic Parenting : Pendidikan Anak Metode Nabi By Jamal Abdurrahman |  Goodreads In holy quran, allah almighty says: Show gratitude to me and to thy parents; Your lord has decreed that you worship none but him, and that you be kind to parents.

This is because there is no worship that can take a person towards the happiness of allah faster than exhibiting respect towards his muslim parents for the sake of allah.” biharul anwar, volume 74, pg.77. The position of parents, and the mutual obligations and responsibilities, have been addressed in islam in great detail. Parents are obligated to be kind to the children.</p>

Prophet (peace be upon him) said: His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. <em>Islamic Parenting : Pendidikan Anak Metode Nabi By Jamal Abdurrahman |  Goodreads</em>, The prophet (saw) declared the parent’s respect that serving one’s parents well is an act of great virtue;</p>
