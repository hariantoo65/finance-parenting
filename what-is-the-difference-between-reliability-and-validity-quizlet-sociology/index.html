Perhaps it did, but what is more likely is that it lacked one of these. Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure (whether the results really do represent what they are supposed to measure).

A reliable measure does not necessarily imply a valid measure.

<p>Reliability Is Defined By The Text As Smart Validity psychology defines the concepts of reliability and validity in the following manner. If your method has reliability, the results will be valid. For example, if a research study takes place, the results should be almost replicated if the study is replicated. Validity describes whether the measured construct is indeed measured by the instrument. When a measure accurately reflects the.</p>

So what is the difference between validity and reliability in research methodology? Although a measurement process might produce results that do not change when repeated (reliability), this does not necessarily mean that the measure is an accurate reflection of the concept under consideration (validity). For example, if a research study takes place, the results should be almost replicated if the study is replicated. The reliability refers to the extent to which a measurement instrument provides consistent results. Understand the difference between positivist and interpretive approaches to the scientific method in sociology;</p>
<p>Validity has more analysis and is harder to achieve. For this to be the case, samples need to be representative, questions or processes need to be uniform and data would generally need to be quantitative. Validity is harder to assess, but it can be estimated by comparing the results to other relevant data or theory. <em>Reliability Is Defined By The Text As Smart</em>, Validity refers to whether the study or measuring test is measuring what is claims to measure.</p>
