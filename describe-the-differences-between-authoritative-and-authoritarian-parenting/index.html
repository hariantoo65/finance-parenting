Authoritative parents are also strict, consistent, and loving, but their values and beliefs about parenting and children are markedly different. Authoritarian parents tend to set very clear rules, and any disrespectful behavior is unacceptable for them and, will have to face the consequences given by their parents.

Authoritarian parents do not allow their children to ask questions.
