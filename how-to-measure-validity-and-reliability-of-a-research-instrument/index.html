Reliability is about the consistency of a measure, and validity is about the accuracy of a measure. Validity is established by correlating the scores with a similar instrument.

<p>How to Determine the Validity and Reliability of an Instrument Validity refers to how accurately a method measures what it is intended to measure. It’s important to consider reliability and validity when you are creating your research. How do you measure reliability of a research instrument? Reliability is about the consistency of a measure, and validity is about the accuracy of a measure. • a scale or test is reliable.</p>
