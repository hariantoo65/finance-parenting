What Is The Difference Between Reliability And Validity Quizlet From slidedocnow.blogspot.com
From a journal article, the researchers used a national database called nsduh to measure the amount of prescription drug. This is because judgments are subjective. Reliability and validity are both about how well a method measures something: Validity is the degree to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure, (field, 2009).

<p>What Is The Difference Between Reliability And Validity Quizlet Reliability is more on the consistency of a measurement, while validity is focused more on how strong the outcome of the program was. This can be split into internal and external reliability. Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure (whether the results can be reproduced under the same conditions). Reliability shows how trustworthy is the score of the test..</p>
