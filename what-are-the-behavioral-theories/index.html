This behavioral perspective or called behaviorism connect incidents and behavior to predict how the personality was being shaped. In psychology, behavioral theories are used to predict responses in individuals and to try and prescribe treatment. Thus, behavior is simply a response to environmental stimuli. Social learning theory social learning theory states that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction, even in the absence of motor reproduction or direct reinforcement. The theory suggests that leaders have innate qualities or traits that help them excel in their roles.</p>
<p>First, behavior theory supports the idea that leadership traits can be learned through development and experience. Effective leaders acquire a pattern of learned behaviours. Proponents of this theory suggest that anyone can become an effective leader if they can learn and implement certain behaviors. <em>Social and Behavior Change Communication Theory Urban Adolescent SRH SBCC</em>, There are two main strengths of behavior theory.</p>
